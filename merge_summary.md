# Merge Summary: PR #30 Eval Rounds Feature

## Status: âœ… Merge Completed Successfully

### Branch: merge-eval-rounds-pr30

## Conflicts Resolved

### 1. `backend/src/controllers/prompt_eval_run.rs`
- **Resolution**: Combined both changes
  - Kept simplified `user_content` assignment from feature branch
  - Added `max_tokens` and `temperature` parameters from upstream
  - Updated error handling to match upstream's detailed format

### 2. `README.md`
- **Resolution**: Accepted upstream's more generic wording for API keys

## Key Changes Integrated

### From Upstream (llmkit-ai:master)
1. **New Providers**:
   - Azure OpenAI support
   - Direct OpenAI support
   - Provider configuration UI

2. **Database Migrations**:
   - Provider support migrations
   - Model provider relationships
   - Reasoning effort tracking

3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Better error handling
   - Provider-specific configurations
   - UI improvements for provider management

### From Feature Branch (alchemiststudiosDOTai:master)
1. **Eval Rounds Support**:
   - `rounds` parameter in API
   - Multiple execution support
   - Run ID tracking for grouped analysis

2. **Testing**:
   - Integration test for rounds feature
   - Validates multiple round execution

## Next Steps

1. **Database Setup**: The code won't compile without a proper database connection due to SQLx compile-time verification. You'll need to:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:./llmkit.db"
   sqlx database create
   sqlx migrate run
   ```

2. **Testing**: After database setup, run:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

3. **Feature Verification**: Test that eval rounds work with all providers:
   - OpenRouter (existing)
   - OpenAI (new)
   - Azure (new)

## Files Modified
- Core conflict resolution: 2 files
- Auto-merged: ~50 files (providers, UI, migrations)
- New files: 4 migrations, multiple provider files

## Notes
- Docker changes were ignored as requested
- The merge preserves both the eval rounds feature and all upstream improvements
- All provider integrations were accepted without modification
